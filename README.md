# Public Inventory Plus

This mod adds a public inventory, which can be used by all players.

To open the public inventory, type:
```
/pi
```
Alternatively, if you are using SFINV (included in Minetest Game) or Unified Inventory, you can open the corresponding tab or click the corresponding button.

## Features
* MineClone support
* Custom size
* SFINV and Unified Inventory integration

## Configuration
Configure the size of the public inventory by setting the number of rows and columns in your `minetest.conf` file:
```conf
pubinv_rows = 3
pubinv_cols = 9
```
